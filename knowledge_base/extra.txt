Below are detailed explanations for each of the identified keywords, each described in 5–8 lines to provide a comprehensive yet concise understanding. These explanations focus on their relevance to the infrastructure industry, particularly in the context of payment delays and subcontractors, while keeping the language accessible and search-friendly.

CWC (Credit on Working Capital): CWC is a bill discounting model that provides subcontractors in infrastructure projects with immediate working capital to address payment delays. Subcontractors submit certified bills to a digital platform, which facilitates low-cost, short-term credit from banks or NBFCs, secured by a contractor’s Letter of Guarantee, without direct client involvement. Unlike traditional bill discounting, CWC aligns credit with project payment timelines, ensuring quick approvals and low default risks. It reduces high-interest borrowing, supports timely wage payments and material procurement, and improves project execution. Automation and tripartite agreements ensure scalability and transparency, effectively resolving subcontractors’ cash flow shortages.
Payment Delays: Payment delays occur when contractors or subcontractors do not receive funds on time for completed work. In infrastructure projects, these delays often stem from slow client approvals, disputes over work quality, or financial bottlenecks. They disrupt cash flow, forcing subcontractors to cover expenses out of pocket, which can lead to project slowdowns. Studies indicate that 70–82% of contractors face delays, with payment cycles stretching to 56–120 days. This causes financial strain, especially for small firms, and can escalate costs by 8% as contractors inflate bids to mitigate risks.
Infrastructure Projects: These are large-scale construction initiatives like roads, bridges, dams, or railways, often funded by governments or private entities. They involve multiple stakeholders, including contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, making coordination complex. Payment delays are common due to lengthy approval processes or funding shortages. These projects are capital-intensive, with budgets often in billions, and delays can lock up significant working capital. Poor planning or scope changes further exacerbate timelines and costs.
Cash Flow Shortages: Cash flow shortages arise when subcontractors lack immediate funds to cover ongoing expenses due to delayed payments. This forces them to dip into profits or borrow at high interest rates, reducing financial stability. In construction, 43% of subcontractors report insufficient working capital for unexpected costs, leading to project halts. These shortages also strain worker payments and material procurement, impacting project progress and subcontractor growth.
Subcontractors: Subcontractors are specialized firms or individuals hired by main contractors to perform specific tasks, such as electrical work or plumbing, in infrastructure projects. They often operate on tight margins and rely on timely payments to manage labor and material costs. Payment delays force them to finance projects out of pocket, with 77% covering materials upfront. This financial burden limits their ability to grow or take on new projects, risking business failure.
Credit Access: Credit access refers to the ability of subcontractors to secure loans or financing to bridge cash flow gaps. Many face challenges due to banks’ reluctance to lend to small firms with unpredictable receivables. Without formal credit, subcontractors turn to high-interest informal lenders, increasing costs. Limited credit access also restricts their ability to manage wages or procure materials, reducing competitiveness and stalling project execution.
Joint Measurement Reports (JMR): JMRs are documents used to verify completed work quantities in infrastructure projects, agreed upon by contractors and clients.

It reduces lender risk, enabling subcontractors to access credit without collateral. In financing models, the LoG shifts repayment responsibility to the contractor, ensuring timely credit access for subcontractors to manage cash flow gaps.
Banks: In the context of infrastructure, banks provide loans or credit facilities to subcontractors, often requiring collateral or guarantees. However, banks are cautious about lending to small subcontractors due to unpredictable payment cycles. Structured financing models, like those using a LoG, make banks more willing to offer short-term credit, improving liquidity for subcontractors.
NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies): NBFCs are financial institutions that provide loans and credit without a banking license. They are more flexible than banks and often fund subcontractors when banks hesitate. NBFCs play a key role in providing short-term credit in models like CWC, using guarantees to minimize risk. Their faster approval processes help subcontractors address cash flow shortages.
Short-Term Credit: This is temporary financing provided to subcontractors to cover immediate expenses like wages or materials during payment delays. Unlike long-term loans, short-term credit has shorter repayment periods and lower risk when backed by guarantees.
