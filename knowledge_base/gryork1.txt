1(a) What are the key reasons for payment delays in infrastructure projects?
Payment delays typically arise from reconciliation discrepancies between contractor records and
client logs; postponed Joint Measurement Reports (JMR) due to coordination issues or
disputes; pending work order amendments when scope or specifications change; work not
meeting required quality standards; incomplete or incorrect billing documents that cause
rejections and resubmissions; slow, multi-layer internal approval processes; contractual
ambiguities that trigger disagreements over billing terms and responsibilities; and simple
unavailability of funds or delayed fund allocation on the client side. Together, these factors stall
bill verification, extend approval timelines, and push back payment disbursal.
1(b) How do these delays impact subcontractors financially?
Payment delays directly create cash flow shortages for subcontractors. Since most
subcontractors operate on thin margins, delayed payments from infrastructure companies
disrupt their ability to pay workers on time, procure materials, and cover site expenses. This
often forces them to rely on high-interest informal borrowing or halt project work altogether,
increasing overall costs and creating wage dissatisfaction among workers. Over time, repeated
delays weaken subcontractors’ financial stability, reduce their capacity to take on new projects,
and erode trust across the value chain.
1(c) What are the main challenges subcontractors face due to lack of credit access?
Subcontractors without access to formal credit face multiple financial and operational
challenges. They often rely on personal savings or informal money lenders who charge very
high interest rates, which increases their financial burden. The lack of liquidity leads to delayed
wage payments for workers, creating dissatisfaction and a risk of labor strikes or worker
turnover. Project timelines get disrupted as material procurement and on-site expenses cannot
be managed smoothly. Subcontractors also lose opportunities to take on new projects because
existing ones remain financially constrained. Over time, this lack of credit access weakens their
bargaining power with infrastructure companies and reduces their competitiveness in the
market.
1(d) How does the payment delay affect workers and project timelines?
Payment delays create a chain reaction starting with workers, who often rely on timely wages for
their daily livelihood. When subcontractors cannot pay wages on time due to pending payments,
worker morale drops, leading to absenteeism, reduced productivity, and sometimes worker
protests or attrition. This directly slows down project execution as labor availability and
motivation decline. Procurement of materials and services also gets delayed due to cash flow
shortages, further extending project timelines. Ultimately, the entire construction schedule
suffers, causing cost overruns, penalty risks for contractors, and strained relationships between
all stakeholders involved.
1(e) What are the current alternatives available to subcontractors for credit?
Subcontractors typically rely on a few limited alternatives for credit when facing payment delays.
The most common option is borrowing from informal money lenders who charge very high
interest rates, which significantly increases project costs. Some subcontractors approach local
cooperative banks or microfinance institutions, but these loans are often small in size and come
with lengthy approval processes. In rare cases, subcontractors may obtain advances from
material suppliers or take personal loans using property or savings as collateral. However, none
of these alternatives provide timely, low-cost, and project-specific credit, leaving subcontractors
financially vulnerable during payment delays.
1(f) How big is the financial gap in the infrastructure industry because of delayed payments?
The financial gap created by delayed payments in the infrastructure industry is substantial.
Large infrastructure projects often run into hundreds or thousands of crores, and even a small
percentage of payment delays can lock up significant working capital. Subcontractors, who
manage labor, materials, and site execution, typically bear the brunt of this gap since they
depend on steady cash flow for day-to-day operations. Industry studies and government reports
have highlighted that delayed payments can hold up billions of rupees across projects at any
given time, causing a ripple effect on project timelines, cost escalations, and the financial health
of small and mid-sized subcontractors.
2(a) What exactly is the CWC model?
The Credit on Working Capital (CWC) model is a structured financing approach designed to
solve liquidity problems for subcontractors in the infrastructure industry. Under this model,
GRYORK partners with banks and NBFCs to provide short-term credit facilities directly to
subcontractors. The infrastructure company issues a Letter of Guarantee to assure repayment
of the sanctioned amount once project payments are released. This allows subcontractors to
access timely funds for paying workers, procuring materials, and covering site expenses without
waiting for client payments, ensuring uninterrupted project execution and improved financial
stability across the value chain.
2(b) How does GRYORK ensure credit availability for subcontractors?
GRYORK ensures credit availability for subcontractors by creating a partnership framework
between infrastructure companies, banks or NBFCs, and subcontractors. The infrastructure
company provides a Letter of Guarantee confirming that the sanctioned amount will be repaid
once project payments are received. Based on this guarantee, GRYORK coordinates with
financial institutions to sanction short-term credit directly to subcontractors. This structure
minimizes the risk for lenders, speeds up credit approvals, and ensures subcontractors receive
funds on time to manage wages, materials, and site expenses without relying on informal
high-cost borrowing sources.
2(c) Who are the key partners involved in the CWC model?
The CWC model involves four key partners working in coordination. First, the infrastructure
company plays a central role by issuing the Letter of Guarantee, assuring repayment once client
payments are received. Second, banks and NBFCs provide the short-term credit facility based
on this guarantee, ensuring timely disbursement of funds. Third, subcontractors are the direct
beneficiaries, using the sanctioned credit to pay workers and manage project expenses. Finally,
GRYORK acts as the facilitator, connecting all stakeholders, structuring the credit flow, and
ensuring transparency and smooth execution of the model.
2(d) What role does the Letter of Guarantee (LoG) play in the model?
The Letter of Guarantee (LoG) is the central risk-mitigation tool in the CWC model. It is issued
by the infrastructure company to the lending bank or NBFC, assuring that the sanctioned credit
given to subcontractors will be repaid once the company receives its project payments from the
client. This guarantee shifts the repayment responsibility from subcontractors to the
infrastructure company, reducing default risk for lenders and enabling them to offer credit at
better terms. It also ensures that subcontractors can access timely working capital without
undergoing lengthy credit checks or offering collateral themselves.
2(e) How does money flow from banks/NBFCs to subcontractors?
In the CWC model, once the infrastructure company issues the Letter of Guarantee, the
partnered bank or NBFC approves the short-term credit facility for the subcontractor. The
sanctioned amount is then directly credited into the subcontractor’s bank account.
Subcontractors use these funds to pay workers, procure materials, and manage project
expenses without waiting for client payments. When the infrastructure company later receives its
pending project payments from the client, it repays the principal amount to the bank or NBFC as
per the agreed terms, completing the credit cycle smoothly.
2(f) Why is this solution better than traditional loan facilities?
The CWC model is better than traditional loan facilities because it is specifically designed for the
unique cash flow challenges in the infrastructure sector. Traditional loans require subcontractors
to provide collateral, undergo lengthy credit checks, and bear full repayment responsibility,
which is often not feasible for small subcontractors with limited financial strength. In contrast, the
CWC model shifts the repayment guarantee to the infrastructure company, allowing faster credit
approvals, lower risk for lenders, and easier access to funds for subcontractors. This structure
ensures liquidity without creating long-term debt burdens or high-interest costs typically
associated with informal borrowing.
2(g) How does this model ensure continuous project execution?
The CWC model ensures continuous project execution by providing subcontractors with
immediate access to working capital, even when payments from clients are delayed. With timely
funds available, subcontractors can pay workers on schedule, procure necessary materials, and
manage site operations without interruption. This prevents labor strikes, delays in material
delivery, and stoppages caused by financial shortages. Since the repayment is guaranteed by
the infrastructure company through the Letter of Guarantee, subcontractors can focus on
completing work rather than worrying about cash flow issues, leading to smoother and faster
project execution.
3(a) Who is responsible for the repayment of the CWC loan?
In the CWC model, the principal repayment responsibility lies with the infrastructure company,
not the subcontractor. Once the infrastructure company receives its pending project payments
from the client, it repays the bank or NBFC as per the terms agreed upon in the Letter of
Guarantee. This arrangement ensures that subcontractors are not burdened with repayment
obligations beyond the interest cost, allowing them to access working capital without long-term
financial risk.
3(b) How is the interest calculated and who pays it?
In the CWC model, the sanctioned amount represents a percentage of the total certified bill
value, while the remaining portion acts as margin money retained with the infrastructure
company. The lending institution charges interest on the disbursed working capital amount for
the period until repayment. By default, the subcontractor bears the interest cost; however, since
the model functions as a bill discounting facility, interest can be adjusted from the retained
margin amount at the time of final bill settlement. Once the infrastructure company receives its
project payments, the principal repayment is made to the bank or NBFC, and the interest
component can be recovered from the margin amount before releasing the balance funds to the
subcontractor.
3(c) When does the principal repayment happen?
In the CWC model, the principal repayment occurs once the infrastructure company receives the
corresponding project payment from the client, within the time period specified in the Letter of
Guarantee (LoG). The LoG clearly defines the repayment timeline agreed upon by the
infrastructure company and the lending institution, ensuring there is no ambiguity regarding the
due date. Once the client releases funds, the infrastructure company settles the principal
amount with the bank or NBFC as per the LoG terms. This time-bound repayment framework
minimizes risk for lenders and keeps the credit cycle aligned with project cash flows.
3(d) What ensures banks and NBFCs face minimal default risk?
Banks and NBFCs face minimal default risk in the CWC model because the credit facility is
backed by a Letter of Guarantee (LoG) issued by the infrastructure company. The LoG clearly
specifies the repayment amount, time period, and obligation of the infrastructure company to
settle the loan once project payments are received from the client. This removes dependency
on subcontractors for principal repayment and links the credit directly to project cash flows.
Additionally, since the credit tenure is short-term and bill-backed, lenders have clear visibility of
repayment timelines, further reducing credit exposure and default risk.
